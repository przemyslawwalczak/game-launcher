# height Integer (optional) - Window's height in pixels. Default is 600.
# x Integer (optional) (required if y is used) - Window's left offset from screen. Default is to center the window.
# y Integer (optional) (required if x is used) - Window's top offset from screen. Default is to center the window.
# useContentSize Boolean (optional) - The width and height would be used as web page's size, which means the actual window's size will include window frame's size and be slightly larger. Default is false.
# center Boolean (optional) - Show window in the center of the screen.
# minWidth Integer (optional) - Window's minimum width. Default is 0.
# minHeight Integer (optional) - Window's minimum height. Default is 0.
# maxWidth Integer (optional) - Window's maximum width. Default is no limit.

# closable Boolean (optional) - Whether window is closable. This is not implemented on Linux. Default is true.
# focusable Boolean (optional) - Whether the window can be focused. Default is true. On Windows setting focusable: false also implies setting skipTaskbar: true. On Linux setting focusable: false makes the window stop interacting with wm, so the window will always stay on top in all workspaces.
# alwaysOnTop Boolean (optional) - Whether the window should always stay on top of other windows. Default is false.
# fullscreen Boolean (optional) - Whether the window should show in fullscreen. When explicitly set to false the fullscreen button will be hidden or disabled on macOS. Default is false.

# default - Results in the standard gray opaque Mac title bar.
# hidden - Results in a hidden title bar and a full size content window, yet the title bar still has the standard window controls ("traffic lights") in the top left.
# hiddenInset - Results in a hidden title bar with an alternative look where the traffic light buttons are slightly more inset from the window edge.
# customButtonsOnHover Boolean (optional) - Draw custom close, minimize, and full screen buttons on macOS frameless windows. These buttons will not display unless hovered over in the top left of the window. These custom buttons prevent issues with mouse events that occur with the standard window toolbar buttons. Note: This option is currently experimental.
# fullscreenWindowTitle Boolean (optional) - Shows the title in the title bar in full screen mode on macOS for all titleBarStyle options. Default is false.
# thickFrame Boolean (optional) - Use WS_THICKFRAME style for frameless windows on Windows, which adds standard window frame. Setting it to false will remove window shadow and window animations. Default is true.
# vibrancy String (optional) - Add a type of vibrancy effect to the window, only on macOS. Can be appearance-based, light, dark, titlebar, selection, menu, popover, sidebar, medium-light or ultra-dark. Please note that using frame: false in combination with a vibrancy value requires that you use a non-default titleBarStyle as well.
# zoomToPageWidth Boolean (optional) - Controls the behavior on macOS when option-clicking the green stoplight button on the toolbar or by clicking the Window > Zoom menu item. If true, the window will grow to the preferred width of the web page when zoomed, false will cause it to zoom to the width of the screen. This will also affect the behavior when calling maximize() directly. Default is false.
# tabbingIdentifier String (optional) - Tab group name, allows opening the window as a native tab on macOS 10.12+. Windows with the same tabbing identifier will be grouped together. This also adds a native new tab button to your window's tab bar and allows your app and window to receive the new-window-for-tab event.
# webPreferences Object (optional) - Settings of web page's features.
#
# devTools Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable DevTools. If it is set to false, can not use BrowserWindow.webContents.openDevTools() to open DevTools. Default is true.
# nodeIntegration Boolean (optional) - Whether node integration is enabled. Default is true.
# nodeIntegrationInWorker Boolean (optional) - Whether node integration is enabled in web workers. Default is false. More about this can be found in Multithreading.
# preload String (optional) - Specifies a script that will be loaded before other scripts run in the page. This script will always have access to node APIs no matter whether node integration is turned on or off. The value should be the absolute file path to the script. When node integration is turned off, the preload script can reintroduce Node global symbols back to the global scope. See example here.
# sandbox Boolean (optional) - If set, this will sandbox the renderer associated with the window, making it compatible with the Chromium OS-level sandbox and disabling the Node.js engine. This is not the same as the nodeIntegration option and the APIs available to the preload script are more limited. Read more about the option here. Note: This option is currently experimental and may change or be removed in future Electron releases.
# session Session (optional) - Sets the session used by the page. Instead of passing the Session object directly, you can also choose to use the partition option instead, which accepts a partition string. When both session and partition are provided, session will be preferred. Default is the default session.
# partition String (optional) - Sets the session used by the page according to the session's partition string. If partition starts with persist:, the page will use a persistent session available to all pages in the app with the same partition. If there is no persist: prefix, the page will use an in-memory session. By assigning the same partition, multiple pages can share the same session. Default is the default session.
# affinity String (optional) - When specified, web pages with the same affinity will run in the same renderer process. Note that due to reusing the renderer process, certain webPreferences options will also be shared between the web pages even when you specified different values for them, including but not limited to preload, sandbox and nodeIntegration. So it is suggested to use exact same webPreferences for web pages with the same affinity. This property is experimental
# zoomFactor Number (optional) - The default zoom factor of the page, 3.0 represents 300%. Default is 1.0.
# javascript Boolean (optional) - Enables JavaScript support. Default is true.
# webSecurity Boolean (optional) - When false, it will disable the same-origin policy (usually using testing websites by people), and set allowRunningInsecureContent to true if this options has not been set by user. Default is true.
# allowRunningInsecureContent Boolean (optional) - Allow an https page to run JavaScript, CSS or plugins from http URLs. Default is false.
# images Boolean (optional) - Enables image support. Default is true.
# textAreasAreResizable Boolean (optional) - Make TextArea elements resizable. Default is true.

# webaudio Boolean (optional) - Enables WebAudio support. Default is true.
# plugins Boolean (optional) - Whether plugins should be enabled. Default is false.
# experimentalFeatures Boolean (optional) - Enables Chromium's experimental features. Default is false.
# experimentalCanvasFeatures Boolean (optional) - Enables Chromium's experimental canvas features. Default is false.
# scrollBounce Boolean (optional) - Enables scroll bounce (rubber banding) effect on macOS. Default is false.
# enableBlinkFeatures String (optional) - A list of feature strings separated by ,, like CSSVariables,KeyboardEventKey to enable. The full list of supported feature strings can be found in the RuntimeEnabledFeatures.json5 file.
# disableBlinkFeatures String (optional) - A list of feature strings separated by ,, like CSSVariables,KeyboardEventKey to disable. The full list of supported feature strings can be found in the RuntimeEnabledFeatures.json5 file.
# defaultFontFamily Object (optional) - Sets the default font for the font-family.
#
# standard String (optional) - Defaults to Times New Roman.
# serif String (optional) - Defaults to Times New Roman.
# sansSerif String (optional) - Defaults to Arial.
# monospace String (optional) - Defaults to Courier New.
# cursive String (optional) - Defaults to Script.
# fantasy String (optional) - Defaults to Impact.
# defaultFontSize Integer (optional) - Defaults to 16.
# defaultMonospaceFontSize Integer (optional) - Defaults to 13.
# minimumFontSize Integer (optional) - Defaults to 0.
# defaultEncoding String (optional) - Defaults to ISO-8859-1.
# backgroundThrottling Boolean (optional) - Whether to throttle animations and timers when the page becomes background. This also affects the Page Visibility API. Defaults to true.
# offscreen Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable offscreen rendering for the browser window. Defaults to false. See the offscreen rendering tutorial for more details.
# contextIsolation Boolean (optional) - Whether to run Electron APIs and the specified preload script in a separate JavaScript context. Defaults to false. The context that the preload script runs in will still have full access to the document and window globals but it will use its own set of JavaScript builtins (Array, Object, JSON, etc.) and will be isolated from any changes made to the global environment by the loaded page. The Electron API will only be available in the preload script and not the loaded page. This option should be used when loading potentially untrusted remote content to ensure the loaded content cannot tamper with the preload script and any Electron APIs being used. This option uses the same technique used by Chrome Content Scripts. You can access this context in the dev tools by selecting the 'Electron Isolated Context' entry in the combo box at the top of the Console tab. Note: This option is currently experimental and may change or be removed in future Electron releases.
# nativeWindowOpen Boolean (optional) - Whether to use native window.open(). Defaults to false. Note: This option is currently experimental.
# webviewTag Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable the <webview> tag. Defaults to the value of the nodeIntegration option. Note: The preload script configured for the <webview> will have node integration enabled when it is executed so you should ensure remote/untrusted content is not able to create a <webview> tag with a possibly malicious preload script. You can use the will-attach-webview event on webContents to strip away the preload script and to validate or alter the <webview>'s initial settings.
# additionalArguments String - A list of strings that will be appended to process.argv in the renderer process of this app. Useful for passing small bits of data down to renderer process preload scripts.
# safeDialogs Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable browser style consecutive dialog protection. Default is false.
# safeDialogsMessage String (optional) - The message to display when consecutive dialog protection is triggered. If not defined the default message would be used, note that currently the default message is in English and not localized.
# navigateOnDragDrop Boolean (optional) - Whether dragging and dropping a file or link onto the page causes a navigation. Default is false.
